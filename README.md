_gitleaks, when needed!_ 

**Gitleaks**, _is an open-source SAST (static application security testing) command line tool for detecting and preventing hardcoded secrets like passwords, API keys and tokens in Git repositories. It can be used as a Git pre-commit hook or in the CI/CD pipeline_.

**Use**, _The tool gitleaks is being used on Git endpoints to prevent a common security issue, namely accidental commits of secrets like Personal Access Token or other credentials to public repositories_.

**Secrets**, _These secrets could be passwords, API keys, tokens, private keys or suspicious file names or file extensions like id_rsa, . pem, htpasswd. Furthermore, gitleaks can scan your whole repository's history with all commits up to the initial one_.

_"**Gitleaks is a fast, light-weight, portable, and open-source secret scanner for git repositories, files, and directories**"_.
