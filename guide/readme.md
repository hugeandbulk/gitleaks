## Securing Your Codebase with GitLeaks: A Comprehensive Guide

**Introduction:**

As software developers, we all know the importance of keeping our codebase secure. One of the most critical steps in securing your codebase is to ensure that sensitive information, such as passwords and keys, is not accidentally committed to your code repository. This is where GitLeaks comes in.

**What is GitLeaks?**

GitLeaks is an open-source tool that scans your code repository for sensitive information that may have been accidentally committed. It scans your codebase for various types of sensitive information. These secrets could be passwords, API keys, tokens, private keys or suspicious file names, or file extensions like id_rsa, .pem, htpasswd.Furthermore, gitleaks can scan your whole repositoryâ€™s history with all commits up to the initial one. This allows you to take immediate action to remove sensitive information and secure your codebase.

**How Does GitLeaks Work?**

GitLeaks works by scanning your code repository for files that match a set of predefined patterns. These patterns are designed to match various types of sensitive information, such as password and key files. Once GitLeaks finds a match, it alerts you, and you can take action to remove the sensitive information.
